# Introduction-to-R

This is the repo that will house our Introduction to R workshop materials. We have developed this workshop after running the UBC R Study Group for many years, as well as teaching/ helping at various Software Carpentry workshops.

Our lesson plan will start off with:
1) Introducing learners to R Studio, working directory organization and R Project
2) How to import data into R?
3) How to munge your dataframe using dplyr?
4) What is tidy dataframe and how to tame your unruly dataframe into a tidier verson?
5) Beautiful figures with ggplot2
6) Wrap-up exercises

1) R [https://www.r-project.org/]
2) RStudio [https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/]
3) R package: `tidyverse` (by typing `install.packages("tidyverse")`)
