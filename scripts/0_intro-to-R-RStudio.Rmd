## What are R and RStudio?

For this workshop, we will be using R via RStudio.

You can think of R like a car's engine, while RStudio is like a car's dashboard.
* R is the programming language that runs computations
* RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) that provides an interface by adding convenient features and tools.

![ModernDive, Figure 1.1.](../images/R_vs_RStudio_v1.png)

So what this means is that, just as we don't drive a car by interacting directly with the engine but rather by interacting with the car's dashboard, we don't be using R directly.

Instead, we will be using the RStudio's interface.

After you open RStudio, you should see the following 3 panels:
* console,
* files,
* and environment.

### What are R pakcages?
R packages extend the functionality of R by providing additional functions, data and documentation
* Think of R packages like apps that you can download onto a mobile phone
* You can get R packages from CRAN
* Or bioinformatics related R packages from bioconductor

So let's continue with this analogy: Let's say you've purchased a new phone (brand new R/RStudio install) and you want to take a photo and share it with your friends and family. So you need to:

1. Install the app.
2. Open the app.

This process is very similar when you are using an R package. You need to:

1. Install the pacakge: Most packages are not installed by default when you install R and RStudio. You will only need to install it again when you need to update it to a newer version.

```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages("tidyverse")
```


2. "Load" or open the package: Packages are not loaded by default when you start RStudio on your computer. So you need to "load" each package you want to use every time you start RStudio.

```{r eval = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```
